                            <b>ü¶í Intuitor:</b> An Intuitor is a person who communicates with empathy and compassion. The term &quot;Big heart&quot; comes from the book &quot;Nonviolent Communication&quot; by Marshall Rosenberg, where he uses the image of a giraffe with a big heart to symbolize nonviolent communication. In this context, I refer to an Intuitor as a &quot;Sincere Giraffe&quot; because they embody the qualities of authentic relating, nonviolent communication, and conflict resolution.

                            <b>ü¶ã Connector:</b>A Connector is someone who communicates through the power of empathy. The concept of the &quot;Empathy Butterfly&quot; represents this type of communication, inspired by the transformative practice of drama therapy. In the same way that an Intuitor is represented by the Sincere Giraffe, a Connector can be symbolized by the Empathy Butterfly. Connectors excel in various areas such as drama therapy, building connections through relating, facilitating celebrations, and fostering meaningful group circles.

                            <b>üêê Enhancer:</b>An Enhancer is someone who channels their energy through focused intention. The symbol of the &quot;Intention Antelope&quot; embodies this concept, representing the Enhancer&apos;s ability to set clear intentions and move forward with purpose. With expertise in practices like Feldenkrais, meditation, yoga, jiujitsu, and somatic/embodiment coaching, the Enhancer possesses a diverse skill set that aids in personal growth and transformation. By utilizing their intentional approach, they empower individuals to cultivate body awareness, mental clarity, and physical well-being.

                            <b>üêô Conjurer:</b>A Conjurer is an individual who skillfully taps into the depths of the subconscious. Represented by the symbol of the &quot;Open Octopus,&quot; the Conjurer embraces the vastness of the inner world and the power of imagination. Through their expertise in art therapy, internal family systems, and subconscious games, they guide individuals on a transformative journey of self-discovery and healing. By creating a safe and nurturing environment, the Conjurer helps individuals explore their hidden emotions, navigate complex inner dynamics, and unlock the potential for personal growth and self-expression.

                            A Manipulator is an individual who adeptly navigates the realm of control and influence. The symbol of the &quot;Control Spider&quot; embodies their ability to intricately weave webs of manipulation. With expertise in areas such as game shows, rituals, and role-play, the Manipulator excels in engaging others through strategic tactics and skillful maneuvering. They possess a keen understanding of social dynamics and utilize their abilities to guide interactions and shape outcomes. While their skills may be utilized ethically and responsibly, it&apos;s important to approach interactions with a Manipulator with awareness and discernment.

Represented by the symbol of the &quot;Focus Ant,&quot; they embody unwavering dedication and meticulous attention to detail. What sets the Specialist apart is their ability to develop their own distinct system and theory by synthesizing knowledge and insights from various fields and other types.
